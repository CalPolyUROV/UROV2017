This is the directory for all test code. This includes code for individual
components like sensors or thrusters. To add a piece of code, please create 
a new folder inside here, and name it to whatever it does. For example, for 
accelerometer code, create a folder called 'Accelerometer', and add your source 
file or file inside it, along with a README like this one explaining what it does.
